# Exercise 0 - Python fundamentals

In this exercise, you get to familiarize yourself with fundamental Python


## 0. Pythagorean theorem

a)  A right angled triangle has the catheti: a = 3 and b = 4 length units. Compute the hypothenuse of the triangle. (*)

b)  A right angled triangle has hypothenuse c = 7.0 and a cathetus a = 5.0 length units. Compute the other cathetus and round to one decimal. (*)




## 1. Classification accuracy (*)
A machine learning model has been trained to detect fire. Here is the result of its predictions: 

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>True Positive (TP)
      <ul>
        <li>Reality: fire</li>
        <li>Predicted: fire</li>
        <li>Number of TP: 2</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>False Positive (FP)
      <ul>
        <li>Reality: no fire</li>
        <li>Predicted: fire</li>
        <li>Number of FP: 2</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>False Negative (FN)
      <ul>
        <li>Reality: fire</li>
        <li>Predicted: no fire</li>
        <li>Number of FN: 11</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>True Negative (TN)
      <ul>
        <li>Reality: no fire</li>
        <li>Predicted: no fire</li>
        <li>Number of TN: 985</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Calculated the accuracy using the following formula:

$\text{accuracy} = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$

Is this a good model? Why? Why not?
