    "\n",
    " Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass, derived or child class) to inherit attributes and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- attributes from parent class are inherited to the child class and can be accessed directly\n",
    "- methods can be overridden in the child class\n",
    "- child class can extend functionality of the parent class \n",
    "- parent class should be more general and child classes more specific \n",
    "\n",
    "- inheritance has stronger coupling between classes and the relation: \"is a\", e.g. a Student is a Person\n",
    "- when changing in the parent class, it might affect the subclasses\n",
    "- when using inheritance, make sure that the relationship really is an \"is a\" relation and not a \"has a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a design concept to create more complex classes from combining simpler components. This also promotes code reusability. \n",
    "- composition has weaker coupling between classes and the relation: \"has a\", e.g. a Classroom have instances of Student, Clock, Chalkboard, Projector, Table \n",
