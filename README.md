# Python fundamentals course

This Python course focuses on fundamental programming principles in Python with some focus towards data engineering. This means some fundamental concepts of data processing and data visualizations will be covered. However, there are more courses that dive more into details of data processing and data visualizations. Further, in the course we will also work with git, github for source control and uv for virtual environment.

The course is a beginner course, but it is good to have some prior knowledge of simple programming concepts.
